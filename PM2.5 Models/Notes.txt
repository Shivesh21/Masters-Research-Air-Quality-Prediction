1) Build in additional metrics to verfify performance
2) Create Validation set for Phola and Medupi -> Need to apply across all forecasts 
3) Back calculate NO1: NO1 = NOX - NO2 -> Almost Done
4) Create 6,12 and 24 models to present next week-> PM2.5 is done, PM 10 almost there
5) Scrutinise the PM10 Data further
6) Fix the overfitting for the Neural net 
7) Maybe fit the LGBM Regressor?
8) Ask Dr Langerman if its possible to get more recent data from Eskom
9) Standardise time stamps to hourly-> 


Goals for 12 August 2025:
Complete back calculation for all models-> done
Finalise Validation sets for Medupi and Phola for all forecasts
Complete PM 10 models

Goals for 13 August 2025.
Finish what was not done on Tuesday
Build in additional metrics

Goals for 14 August 2025
Apply metrics to all forecasts for PM2.5 and PM 10
Standardise time stamps
Run that on PM2.5 models
